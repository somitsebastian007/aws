Create Application Load Balancer:
================================

1. Use default inputs. Give inputs to below:
    ==> user defined name for LB
    ==> Select all AZ's
    ==> Create a new security group & assign to LB
        --> Create a inbound rule with Type 'HTTP' & Source 'Anywhere'
    ==> Create target group
        --> Target type: Instance
        --> Target group name: target-server  # user defined
        --> Port: 80 # default
        --> Register Instances: Add the ec2 servers and mention port as 80


Points:
========
1. You can monitor the health of instance in Target Group. LB only routes traffic to healthy nodes
2. You can add more rules under 'Listeners and rules'

ECS Core Concepts and Terminology
=================================
Before diving into the details, let's understand the fundamental building blocks of ECS:

Task Definition
        Blueprint describing how containers should launch
        Defines settings like ports, images, CPU, memory, and environment variables
        Similar to a Docker Compose file but specific to ECS

Tasks
        Running containers with settings defined in Task Definitions
        Can contain single or multiple containers
        Represents actual running instances of your application

Services
        Maintain specified number of running tasks
        Handle load balancing and scaling
        Ensure high availability of applications

Clusters
        Logical grouping of container instances
        Can span multiple Availability Zones
        Provide resource management and scaling capabilities
        
Container Instances
        EC2 instances registered to ECS clusters
        Run Docker daemon and ECS agent
        Execute tasks assigned by the scheduler
