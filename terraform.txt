Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
=============================

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a way to manage and provision computer data centers through machine-readable 
configuration files, rather than physical hardware or interactive configuration tools.

Example:
Instead of clicking around in a cloud dashboard to create a server, you write a script 
(like in Terraform or AWS CloudFormation) that says:

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
